It cannot always be guarunteed that signals will always be recieved. Sometimes if the parent recieves multiple signals at one time
it may block signals and cause them to become pending signals. This would cause the rest of the signals to never be handled since they are
never recieved. It may also be caused by sleep. My understanding of sleep is that when it is called within a signal handler it may cause some strange
behavior. In short, the bug must be caused by the parent blocking some of the signals sent to it by the child process.
